## Background story

*Skip this section, if you aren't interested. See you at the technical details. ðŸ˜‰*

As I was reading Adam Neary's article of [Rearchitecting Airbnbâ€™s Frontend](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rearchitecting-airbnbs-frontend-5e213efc24d2), two components caught my attention as a junior frontend developer. These were `HideAt` and `ShowAt`. This is why the inspiration came from Airbnb.

`react-with-breakpoint` is the parent of `HideAt` and `ShowAt`, a higher order component.
